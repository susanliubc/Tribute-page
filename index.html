        <p>Since childhood, Zengqi Wang's life was never far away from wars and campaigns for political change. Experiencing poverty, hunger, unemployment, seperation, and despisement, he still remained an intact inner world that had been nourished by seeking and chrishing life's goodness. Unlike some of his peers, Zengqi always demonstrated a traditonal Chinese scholar's life attitude: calm, natrual, and happy-go-lucky. The Cultural Revolution destrucated traditional Chinese culture and values, thus directly led to the formation of at least three generation of inadequately civilized individuals. Wang, regarded as "the last pure Chinese scholar", and his rich in spirit life style are worthy of study, given the fact of the spiritual poverty pervasive among current Chinese intellectual life.</p>
      
        <p>A series of short stories were deemed to be his apogees of writing. The character of his contemprary works portrayed the rural life lyrically. These works stimulate writers of root-searching literature in the mid- and late 1980s.</p>
      
        <p>Wang had a grasp of advanced culinary skills and was considered as a gourmet. This enthusiasm is also revealed in many of his works, such as "Hometown Foods".</p>
